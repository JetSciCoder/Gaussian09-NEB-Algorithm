# Gaussian09-NEB-Algorithm
An open source NEB algorithm meant to interface with Gaussian09 for computational chemical research

This code uses what is called a Nudged Elastic Band Algorithm, or NEB, which takes an intial chemical configuration (the
reactant) and a final configuration (the product) and does a linear interporlation between the two. These images are then
submitted to Gaussian which then does quantum mechanical force and energy calculations. These forces are then taken in
addi
